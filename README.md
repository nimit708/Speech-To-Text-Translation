# Speech-To-Text-Translation
In this project, I have used Watson APIs to convert an audio from speech to text(Speech to Text API) and then convert the text into french language(Language Converter API). I have also used Pandas library with methods like json_normalise to convert the json output file(output received after accessing the API )into a dataframe.
